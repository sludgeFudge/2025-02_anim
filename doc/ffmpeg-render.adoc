== FFMPEG Rendering 

Since DaVinci Resolve cannot export to MP4 in the free version,
use FFMPEG to do it for you.

[source,bash]

ffmpeg in.mkv out.mp4

Since these videos are meant for the YT shorts format, I wanted the videos to loop as well.
Use the `-stream_loop` tag to do so. 

* `0`: no loop
* `-1`: infinite
* `n`: loops n+1 times. So a value of `1` will make the video loop 2 times.

[source,bash]
----
ffmpeg -stream_loop 2 -i cat-throw-pot_out1.mp4 cat-throw-pot_out1_handbrake-loop.mp4
ffmpeg -stream_loop 3 -i stamp-vignette_out1_handbrake.mp4 stamp-vignette_out1_hanbrake-loop.mp4
